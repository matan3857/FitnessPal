Your core should be engaged to keep your ribs down and your pelvis should be slightly tucked at the top. Your shins should be vertical.\n\n6. Pause for 2–3 seconds at the top.\n\n7. To begin the downward movement, hinge from your hips to return to the starting position. Allow your chest to follow your hips. Gaze forward while keeping your chin tucked.
