            <h1>10 REASONS TO JOIN A GYM</h1>
            <p className="text">1. It’s good for your health</p>
            <p>We’re stating the obvious with this one but did you know that being active daily reduces the risk of heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes? </p>
            <p className="text">2. It’s good for your mind</p>
            <p>When you exercise, endorphins are released which can calm anxiety and lift your mood.</p>
            <p className="text">3. It’s a great stress buster</p>
            <p>Had a busy day? There is nothing more rewarding then running further or lifting heavier than you have before. Plus, the fitter you get, the better your body is at regulating cortisol levels (the hormone linked to stress).</p>
            <p className="text">4. Access to equipment</p> 
            <p>Being a member of a gym means you have access to tons of equipment, allowing you to keep your routine fresh and exciting.</p>
            <p className="text">5. Access to knowledge</p>
            <p>If you’re a workout newbie, a gym membership can give you the tools and knowledge to start out. Learn the ropes by booking on the induction programme, attending classes or even get a Personal Trainer</p>
            <p className="text">6. It keeps you motivated</p>
            <p>Going to the gym and being surrounded by motivated people can encourage you to stay on track. Plus, having somewhere to go sounds more appealing then working out in the park or in your living room.</p>
            <p className="text">7. You get an all-weather workout</p>
            <p>Ever binned off a run because it was raining? Ditched the outdoor bootcamp because it was dark? The gym offers a great place to work out whatever the weather and time of year, so no excuses!</p>
            <p className="text">8. Meet like-minded people</p>
            <p>Joining a gym can be quite social. If you’re a regular at classes, then you begin to get to know people and before you know it you’re lifelong friends.</p>
            <p className="text">9. It will improve your sleep</p>
            <p>Studies show that people who exercise 5 to 6 times a week are more likely to get a good night’s kip.</p>
            <p className="text">10. You can have somewhere to relax</p>
            <p>Generally, people join a gym to workout but they are actually a great place to unwind. A gentle swim or sit in the sauna for some ‘me time’ will have you zen before you know it.</p>
